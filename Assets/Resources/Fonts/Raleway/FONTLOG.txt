  Raleway Font Information
  
  Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed in a 
  single thin weight. It is a display face that features both 
  old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary 
  ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as 
  a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif 
  typefaces than it's neo-grotesque inspired default 
  character set.
